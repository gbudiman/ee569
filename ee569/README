ASSUMPTIONS: User will supply either correct type for ALL arguments OR supply NO argument. When no argument is provided, help message will be provided. However, when user passes ALL arguments, but one or more are of the wrong type or in the wrong order, there will be no exception handler (i.e. the program will simply terminate with uncaught exception)
